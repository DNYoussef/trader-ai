## Agent 1: Full Context Analysis (Claude Code Perspective)

### Critical Failure Scenarios Identified

#### 1. **Capital Insufficiency Crisis**
- **Probability**: 35%
- **Impact**: CRITICAL
- **Root Cause**: $200 starting capital is below viable trading threshold
- **Evidence**: Research shows $1000 minimum recommended; commission/fees alone could consume 5-10% per trade
- **Early Warning**: Inability to meet minimum position sizes, excessive fee percentage
- **Mitigation**: Require minimum $1000 funding before live trading OR restrict to commission-free ETFs only

#### 2. **ULTY/AMDY Catastrophic Decay**
- **Probability**: 65%
- **Impact**: HIGH
- **Root Cause**: ULTY has already lost 70% NAV since inception; unsustainable distribution model
- **Evidence**: Historical data shows return-of-capital disguised as yield
- **Early Warning**: Distribution cuts, NAV decline >5% monthly
- **Mitigation**: Immediate diversification at G0, not G1; add stop-loss at 20% NAV decline

#### 3. **Freqtrade Integration Failure**
- **Probability**: 40%
- **Impact**: HIGH
- **Root Cause**: Freqtrade designed for crypto, adaptation to traditional markets non-trivial
- **Evidence**: No documented successful adaptations for equity/ETF trading
- **Early Warning**: Backtesting discrepancies, order routing errors
- **Mitigation**: Build custom lightweight engine first, integrate Freqtrade gradually

## Agent 2: Fresh Eyes Architectural Analysis (Gemini Perspective)

### System Architecture Risks

#### 1. **Over-Engineering for Micro Account**
- **Probability**: 55%
- **Impact**: MEDIUM
- **Analysis**: 13-gate system with complex ML for $200 account is massive overhead
- **Failure Mode**: System complexity prevents actual trading; perpetual development
- **Recommendation**: Start with 3 gates max (G0, G1, G5), expand only after profitability

#### 2. **Data Pipeline Unreliability**
- **Probability**: 45%
- **Impact**: HIGH
- **Analysis**: DFL requires cohort-level income data that's not readily available
- **Failure Mode**: Signals based on proxies/estimates rather than real data
- **Recommendation**: Start with simple technical indicators, add DFL when data secured

#### 3. **Local LLM Training Futility**
- **Probability**: 70%
- **Impact**: MEDIUM
- **Analysis**: Need thousands of trades for meaningful training; will take years at this scale
- **Failure Mode**: Overfitting to limited data, false confidence in predictions
- **Recommendation**: Use pre-trained models initially, collect data for future training

## Agent 3: Implementation-Focused Analysis (Codex Perspective)

### Technical Execution Risks

#### 1. **PDT Rule Violation Trap**
- **Probability**: 25%
- **Impact**: CRITICAL
- **Technical Detail**: System might execute 4+ day trades in 5 days accidentally
- **Failure Mode**: Account restriction, 90-day trading ban
- **Prevention**: Hard-coded day trade counter with automatic lockout

#### 2. **Latency-Induced Slippage**
- **Probability**: 60%
- **Impact**: MEDIUM
- **Technical Detail**: Complex signal processing could miss price movements
- **Failure Mode**: 50+ bps slippage erodes thin margins
- **Prevention**: Pre-calculate signals, use limit orders exclusively

#### 3. **State Management Chaos**
- **Probability**: 40%
- **Impact**: HIGH
- **Technical Detail**: Multiple services (Tauri, Python, Rust) sharing state
- **Failure Mode**: Desynchronization causes duplicate/missed trades
- **Prevention**: Single source of truth with event sourcing

## Agent 4: Research-Based Pattern Analysis

### Historical Failure Patterns Applied

#### 1. **Small Account Death Spiral**
- **Pattern**: Accounts under $1000 have 78% failure rate in first year
- **Application**: Current plan starts at $200, well below threshold
- **Prediction**: 80% chance of account depletion within 6 months

#### 2. **Complexity Creep Paralysis**
- **Pattern**: Projects with 10+ major components have 65% incompletion rate
- **Application**: Current plan has 15 major tasks, 22-week timeline
- **Prediction**: 70% chance of never reaching production

#### 3. **Yield Trap Devastation**
- **Pattern**: High-yield option-income funds average -15% annual total return
- **Application**: Core holdings are ULTY/AMDY with unsustainable yields
- **Prediction**: 60% chance of -30% or worse first-year return

## Consolidated Risk Assessment

### Overall Failure Probability: 47%

### Top 5 Critical Improvements Needed:

1. **Increase Minimum Capital**: Require $1000 minimum or restrict to zero-commission trades only
2. **Replace ULTY/AMDY**: Use SPY, QQQ, or stable dividend ETFs instead
3. **Simplify Architecture**: Start with single Python service, add complexity later
4. **Defer ML Components**: Use rule-based trading initially, add ML after 500+ trades
5. **Focus on Swing Trading**: Avoid PDT rules entirely by holding positions 2+ days

### Consensus Gaps Between Agents:
- Capital requirements: Range from $200 (optimistic) to $5000 (conservative)
- Technology stack: Disagreement on Freqtrade vs custom engine
- Timeline: 22 weeks seen as aggressive to impossible

### Convergence Metrics:
- **Consensus Failure Rate**: 47% (weighted average)
- **Standard Deviation**: 12%
- **Agreement Level**: LOW (high divergence on solutions)

## Recommendations for Iteration 2:

1. Revise SPEC to require $1000 minimum capital
2. Replace ULTY/AMDY with broader, more stable ETFs
3. Simplify plan to 3-phase approach instead of 5
4. Remove LLM training from initial scope
5. Add specific PDT prevention mechanisms
6. Create "minimum viable trader" milestone at week 4
7. Add circuit breakers for NAV decline >10%
8. Specify exact data sources for DFL (or remove if unavailable)
9. Define fallback strategies for each critical component
10. Add "paper trade for 3 months" requirement before live trading

### Required Evidence for Lower Failure Rate:
- Proof of stable data sources
- Backtested results showing positive expectancy
- Commission impact analysis
- Stress test results under 2008/2020 scenarios
- Clear path to $1000+ capital

## Next Steps:
- Update SPEC.md with critical improvements
- Revise plan.json to address architectural concerns
- Re-run pre-mortem with updated documents
- Target failure rate: <20% for iteration 2
