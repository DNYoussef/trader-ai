# Guild of the Rose Education System

## Overview

The Gary√óTaleb Trading System now incorporates Guild of the Rose's proven self-improvement methodologies to create a comprehensive trading education platform. This system combines rational decision-making, antifragility principles, and systematic skill development to accelerate trader growth from G0 ($200) to G12 ($10M+).

## Core Philosophy

### Guild of the Rose Integration

Our education system is built on five key Guild of the Rose methodologies:

1. **Babble & Prune**: Generate many trading strategies, then systematically filter the best
2. **Decision Theory**: Rational decision-making under uncertainty with mathematical precision
3. **Antifragility**: Building systems that benefit from market volatility and stress
4. **Metalearning**: Learning how to learn trading skills more effectively
5. **Energy Management**: Optimizing cognitive resources for peak trading performance

### Learning Progression

The system follows a structured progression aligned with capital gates:
- **G0-G2**: Foundation building (Decision Theory, Basic Risk Management)
- **G3-G5**: Strategy Development (Momentum, Antifragility principles)
- **G6-G8**: Advanced Techniques (Psychology mastery, Complex systems)
- **G9-G12**: Expert Level (Meta-cognition, Teaching others)
