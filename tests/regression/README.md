    # ... other thresholds
}
```

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
1. **Baseline Updates**: Update baselines when legitimate performance improvements are made
2. **Threshold Adjustments**: Adjust failure thresholds based on production requirements
3. **Test Data Updates**: Refresh test datasets to reflect current codebase patterns
4. **Environment Validation**: Ensure test environment matches production characteristics

### Adding New Performance Tests
```python
def test_new_performance_metric(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Test new performance optimization."""
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    
    # Implement performance measurement
    measured_value = self.measure_new_metric()
    baseline_value = self.performance_baselines['new_metric']
    
    end_time = time.perf_counter()
    
    # Check for regression
    threshold = baseline_value * self.degradation_thresholds['new_metric']
    passed = measured_value >= threshold
    
    return {
        'passed': passed,
        'measured_value': measured_value,
        'baseline_value': baseline_value,
        'threshold_value': threshold,
        'execution_time': end_time - start_time,
        'summary': f"New Metric: {measured_value} (target: {baseline_value})"
    }
```

## Integration with Monitoring

### Production Monitoring Integration
```python
# Real-time performance monitoring
monitor = RealTimePerformanceMonitor()
monitor.start_continuous_monitoring()

# Alert on degradation
if monitor.detect_performance_degradation():
    # Trigger regression test suite
    suite = PerformanceRegressionSuite()
    results = suite.run_complete_regression_suite()
    
    # Send alerts if regression confirmed
    if results['success_rate'] < 90:
        send_performance_alert(results)
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Performance Regression Check
  run: |
    python tests/regression/performance_regression_suite.py
  continue-on-error: false
  
- name: Performance Alert
  if: failure()
  uses: actions/alert@v1
  with:
    message: "Performance regression detected in build ${{ github.run_number }}"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Environment Differences**
   - Ensure test environment matches production specs
   - Account for hardware differences in baselines
   - Use relative performance metrics when possible

2. **Test Data Staleness**
   - Regularly update test datasets
   - Ensure test data represents current usage patterns
   - Balance test data size with execution time

3. **Flaky Performance Tests**
   - Run multiple iterations and use statistical analysis
   - Account for system load and background processes
   - Implement warm-up periods for accurate measurements

4. **False Positives**
   - Adjust thresholds based on acceptable variance
   - Implement confidence intervals for measurements
   - Use trend analysis rather than single-point comparisons

### Performance Investigation
When regression is detected:

1. **Identify Scope**: Which specific metrics are degraded?
2. **Timeline Analysis**: When did the degradation start?
3. **Change Correlation**: What code changes occurred around the degradation?
4. **Environment Check**: Are there infrastructure or dependency changes?
5. **Deep Profiling**: Use detailed profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
6. **Rollback Testing**: Test if reverting specific changes fixes the issue

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive performance degradation detection
- **Automated Optimization**: Self-healing performance optimization
- **Advanced Profiling**: Integration with advanced profiling tools
- **Cloud Integration**: Multi-environment performance comparison
- **Real-User Monitoring**: Production performance feedback loop

This regression test suite ensures that the exceptional performance achievements of Phase 3 are maintained throughout the product lifecycle, providing confidence in continued high performance delivery.
